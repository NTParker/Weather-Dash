# Weather-Dash

https://ntparker.github.io/Weather-Dash/

This project's goal was to create a weather application using the OpenWeatherMap API, in which a user could input the name of a city and be presented with detailed information regarding the city's current weather. When the user types the name of a city they are presented with the date, temperature, humidity, windspeed, and UV index. The page also includes a five day forecast to provide the user with future weather conditions for their searched city. Additionally, the page uses local storage to store the user's search history and display it on the page for quick navigation between searched cities weather data.
